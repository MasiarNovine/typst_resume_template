# A resume template in typst

This is a template for a resume in typst. It can be simply
imported at the start of a `typ` file:

```rust
#import "template": *

//...
```

Currently, the functions `headerblock()`, `cventry` and `cvitem` are used to compose the resume. For usage and the arguments, see the `example.typ` file.

## Acknowledgements
